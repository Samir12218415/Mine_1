    <h1>WHAT IS SOIL EROSION?</h1>
    <p>Soil erosion is the denudation or wearing away of the upper layer of soil. It is a form of soil degradation.<br> This natural process is caused by the dynamic activity of erosive agents, that is, water, ice (glaciers), snow, air (wind), <br> plants, and animals (including humans). In accordance with these agents, erosion is sometimes divided into water erosion,<br>  glacial erosion, snow erosion, wind (aeolean) erosion, zoogenic erosion and anthropogenic erosion such as tillage <br> erosion.[1] Soil erosion may be a slow process that continues relatively unnoticed, or it may occur at <br> an alarming rate causing a serious loss of topsoil. </p>

            <p>
                Following are the important causes of soil erosion:

                1. <a href="https://youmatter.world/en/definition/definitions-what-is-definition-deforestation-causes-effects/"><strong>Deforestation</a></strong>   for Agriculture Is One of the Top Causes of Soil Erosion
                The increasingly high demand of a growing population for commodities such as coffee, soybean, palm oil or wheat is clearing land for agriculture. Unfortunately, clearing autochthonous trees and replacing them with new tree crops that don’t necessarily hold onto the soil increases the risks of soil erosion. With time, as topsoil (the most nutrient-rich part of the soil) is lost, putting agriculture under threat.

                class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-560930" />
                2. Soil Erosion is Also Caused by <strong>Overgrazing</strong>, Which Causes Floods too:
                Overgrazing is caused by intensive cattle raising. As plants don’t have the recovery period they need, they end up being crushed and compacted by cattle. In this process, topsoil sediments are transported elsewhere. As for the remaining soil, it can lose its infiltration capacity, which means more water getting lost from the ecosystem and a harder time for new plants to grow.
                3. <img src="Agrochem.jpg" class="center" width="800" height="600" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-560930" />
                <strong>Agrochemicals Cause Soil Erosion and Degradation</strong> :
                The use of chemicals under the form of pesticides and fertilizers on (often) monocultural crops is a very usual way of helping farmers improve their yields. However, the excessive use of phosphoric chemicals ends up causing an imbalance of microorganisms in the soil moisture, stimulating the growth of harmful bacteria. As the soil gets degraded, the risk of erosion increases and the sediments sweep (via the actions of water and wind) into rivers and nearby regions, possibly contaminating nearby ecosystems.
                At the same time, tillage techniques (that turn over crops and forages) commonly used by farmers to prepare seedbeds by incorporating manure and fertilizers, leveling the soil and taking out invasive seeds also have a large impact. Because it fractures the soil’s structure, tillage ends up accelerating surface runoff and soil erosion.
                4.  <img src="dam.jpg" class="center" width="800" height="600" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-560930" />
                <strong>Construction and Recreational Activities:</strong> 
                Setting up buildings and roads also have their share of responsibility when it comes to soil erosion as they don’t allow for the normal circulation of water. Instead, it runs off to flood nearby lands, speeded up erosion in these areas. Moreover, motor-based activities such as motocross also have the potential to disturb ecosystems and change (even if at a smaller scale compared with other causes) and erode the soil.
                <h2><strong>The Importance of Soil, Especially Topsoil</strong></h2>
               <p> Soil is a very important resource that allows the production of food, fiber, or forages. Despite it being a renewable resource, it renews slowly – generating three centimeters of topsoil takes 1,000 years. Therefore, protecting it is very important to bet on long-term, sustainable agricultural practices since one of the main issues associated with soil erosion is that it comes along a decrease in soil productivity. These productivity losses reduce the quantity and quality of the food we eat.
                A <a href="https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US880034288"><strong>study</strong></a>  based on the results of 40 soil associations reported that the effects of soil erosion on soil productivity were mostly the result of subsoil properties such as soil water availability, root growth or plow layer fertility – which impact yield results. In the end, with an unfavorable subsoil, erosion is easier and yields and productivity are more greatly affected.</p>

        <h3>WHAT?</h3>
        <p>This website is just made for educationalal purpose for people to get a better idea of soil erosion in brief and some sustainable ways to keep it in limit.</p>

    <div class="cat-col">    
        <h3>WHY?</h3>
        <p>According to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), some key roles of soils are:

           <br> &#9830; Soils help fight and adapt to climate change by collecting and storing carbon and reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in the atmosphere;
           <br> &#9830; Resilient soils allow for water infiltration through the soil, filtering pollutants and preventing them from leaching into the groundwater;
            <br> &#9830; Soils capture and store water for crops, whereas degraded soils retain less water;
            <br>&#9830; Reducing surface evaporation and increasing water use efficiency and productivity are also processes enhanced by healthy soils;
            <br>&#9830; Soils provide fiber, fuel, medicinal products, and other ecosystem services;
            <br>&#9830; Soils are home to 1/4 of biodiversity and they are a key part of the global cycles that make all life possible</p>
